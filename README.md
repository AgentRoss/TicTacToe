#TicTacToe 

A Tic-Tac-Toe game built in React.js is a classic two-player game where users take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O". The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. This React.js implementation showcases components, state management, and event handling to create an interactive user interface.
